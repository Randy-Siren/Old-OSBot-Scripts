# Old-OSBot-Scripts
Various scripts written for botting platform OSBot (finished and unfinished)

The projects in this repository is a collection of just a small part (around 5%) of the work I've put in throughout my high school years as a hobby for myself and users who requested it. These projects were the most unique and interesting learning experiences for me which I enjoyed working on. Taught me a lot of what to do and what NOT to do, hence there will be many poor practices demonstrated here. 

NOTE: All these scripts are HEAVILY outdated and must be rewritten since OSBot's API has significantly changed (for the better).

TwitchBot - Link a twitch.tv account and while running, the script will read the chat (IRC-based) and perform actions based on set commands in the actual game. 

Build-a-Script Workshop - User created their own mini-scipt by combining hundreds of actions and loops provided by the script to make simple scripts open to anyone. The possibilities were endless and users could share scripts they made via files generated. One of my personal favourites.

Slayer - A slayer script I never got the change to finish however the foundation and framework was completely laid out with an incredibly complex GUI setup with full functionality. All that was left to do was gather in game data and create the logic from OSBot API. A cornerstone of my understanding of Inheritance and common programming concepts.
